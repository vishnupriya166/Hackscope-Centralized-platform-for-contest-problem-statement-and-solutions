# Hackscope-Centralized-platform-for-contest-problem-statement-and-solutions
Created a centralized platform where users can explore and solve problems across domains like IoT, Cybersecurity, and
 Data Science. Built features like user login, an AI chatbot for suggestions, and integration with GitHub and YouTube.
 Users can also submit their own solutions, rate others, and give feedback to support shared learning.
